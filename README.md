**Project Status:** Beta - Ready for early adopters and contributors! Expect some rough edges, but core functionality is solid.

## 🌟 Bringing Back the Magic of Start Pages

**Remember the golden days of My Yahoo and iGoogle?** Boxento is bringing that back - but better, open source, and completely in your control.

- **Seasoned developers** can dive deep into our codebase
- **Hobby coders** can modify existing widgets to suit their needs
- **Complete beginners** can use LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, or LLM based code editors like Cursor or Windsurf to help generate widget code

There are no gatekeepers here - just bring your imagination, and we'll help you make it real. Check out our [Widget Development Guide](/docs/WIDGET_DEVELOPMENT.md) and [Template Widget](/src/components/widgets/TemplateWidget) to get started. Simply load these files into your favorite AI coding assistant and describe what you want to create!
