# YouTube AutoPlay Widget

Plays the most recent video from each channel configured in the **YouTube Favorites** widget, one after the other.

## Requirement

This widget only works after **YouTube Favorites** has been configured/saved at least once (it reads the channel list from a shared snapshot in localStorage).

## Settings

- **Seconds per video**: how long to play before switching to the next channel.
- **Mute**: recommended (autoplay restrictions).
- **Show controls**: show/hide YouTube player controls.
- **Loop**: continuously cycle channels.
